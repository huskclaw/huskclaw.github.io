# Catch the Yakisoba!!

# This game is inspired by an anime scene "Nichijou" where Mio asked Yuuko to buy yakisoba, but Yuuko bought Yakisaba instead. 
# The goal of this game is to catch yakisoba that fall from the sky, and avoid catching yakisaba. Score 15 to win. If you touch yakisaba, it will reduce your lives point.
